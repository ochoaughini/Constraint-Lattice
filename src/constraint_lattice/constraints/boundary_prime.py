"""Boundary-Prime identity constraint.

This lightweight constraint asserts non-personhood in a deterministic,
transparent way. It uses *jax.numpy* if available so that it can participate
in differentiable policy flows, but gracefully falls back to *numpy* on
systems where JAX is not installed (e.g. CPU-only CI).
