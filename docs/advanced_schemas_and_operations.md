# Advanced Schemas and Operational Extensions

This document expands on the core Constraint Lattice documentation with formal schema definitions and operational guidance.

## 1. Formal Constraint Graph Schema

Constraint resolution is expressed as a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ where each node $v \in V$ represents a constraint or intermediate value and each edge $(u \to v) \in E$ captures information flow between nodes.

### Node Attributes
- **Vector embedding**: semantic vector representing the content or rule associated with the node.
- **Active flag**: indicates whether the constraint is currently triggered.
- **`resonance_score`**: numeric alignment measure used during propagation.

### Edge Semantics
A directed edge implies that node `u` must be evaluated before `v`. Edges may propagate activation or values from predecessors to successors.

### Propagation and Traversal
The engine traverses the constraint graph in topological order where possible. Cycles are detected via strongly connected component analysis and may be collapsed into a single aggregate constraint for resolution.

### Cycle Handling
When cycles are present, the engine either collapses nodes in the cycle or aborts with an error depending on configuration. Cycle detection prevents infinite propagation loops.

A Graphviz diagram or similar visualisation can be used to illustrate this schema in practice.

## 2. Drift Metrics and Heuristic Divergence

Alignment drift is measured using embeddings of the symbolic topology. Given the current topology embedding `T` and a historical memory embedding `M`, drift is defined as:

$$\mathrm{drift}(T, M) = \| \mathrm{encode}(T) - M \|_2.$$

Thresholds on this score determine when re-alignment routines should run. Logging drift over time helps operators detect gradual behaviour changes.

Heuristics include reinforcing constraints when drift grows, or relaxing strategies when alignment remains high. The containment and autolearning functions use this score internally.

## 3. Threat Model and Mitigations

Potential attack vectors include:
- **Constraint injection**: malicious rules inserted via configuration files or plugins.
- **Semantic leakage during propagation**: sensitive data exposed through intermediate states.
- **Denial-of-policy enforcement**: attempts to disable or bypass constraint evaluation.

Mitigations:
- Sandbox constraint execution with strict resource limits.
- Validate YAML/JSON profiles against schemas before loading.
- Use checksums or signatures for official constraint packages.
- Fail safe on errors and monitor for unusual drift or trigger patterns.

## 4. Integration Guide for Runtime Embedding

Constraint Lattice can be embedded as a middleware layer or sidecar service.

### Pre-Generation Hooks
Wrap LLM inference so that generated text is filtered before being returned. Streaming output can be checked in parallel to minimise latency.

### Mid-Session Adjustment
Constraints may be activated or deactivated dynamically in response to conversation context using the provided API calls.

### Outcome Handling
Violations can result in sanitized replacements, rejections, or escalation to human moderators. Audit logs and metrics should record which rule fired.

### Metrics Emission
Expose Prometheus metrics such as evaluation time, number of blocks, and drift values. Webhooks or alerts can integrate moderation events with incident systems.

### Deployment Models
The engine may run in the same process as the LLM, in a microservice, or as a batch moderation tool. Sidecar and containerized deployments are supported.

## 5. Performance Profiling and System Metrics

When benchmarking, distinguish cold start times from warm-path execution. Profiling shows that enabling the meta orchestrator adds small overhead compared to base generation. High performance backends such as vLLM can greatly increase throughput.

Memory usage grows primarily with the number of loaded embeddings. Evaluate complex constraint sets in parallel where possible and monitor latency per request.

Synthetic benchmarks are recommended for capacity planning: vary prompt length and constraint count to measure overhead. Tools like `cProfile` or FastAPI middleware timing can assist in profiling custom deployments.
