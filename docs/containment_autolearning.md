# Containment and Autolearning Architecture

The `apply_containment_constraints` and `recursive_autolearning_orchestrator` functions form an integrated core of the Constraint Lattice cognitive substrate. They work in tandem to enforce feedback-aligned containment while enabling recursive self-optimisation.

## 1. `apply_containment_constraints`
`apply_containment_constraints` accepts three inputs:

- `cognitive_state`: runtime dictionary of state embeddings for each module.
- `feedback_stream`: structured vector trace representing recent feedback.
- `symbolic_topology`: directed graph describing inter-module relations.

For each node in the topology the function retrieves the associated state vector and correlates it with the feedback stream to produce a resonance score. Nodes whose resonance falls below a containment threshold have their propagation pathways suppressed, while those exceeding an amplification threshold are strengthened. Once node-level modulation is complete the topology undergoes a structural optimisation step that removes redundant loops and reinforces forward directionality to maintain semantic coherence. The updated topology is returned.

## 2. `recursive_autolearning_orchestrator`
`recursive_autolearning_orchestrator` operates on the updated topology, a `memory_embedding` encoding historical semantic states and an `epoch` integer that identifies the learning phase. It derives a heuristic drift score between the topology and memory embedding. If this score surpasses a drift threshold the orchestrator synthesises a new strategy and reindexes macro phases to reprioritise execution order. Symbolic weights and schedules within the topology are updated to reflect this strategy. When the drift is insignificant a stability marker is returned with no structural changes.

## 3. Feedback-Regulated Loop
Containment filtering ensures symbolic propagation remains bounded by recent feedback, while autolearning evaluates long-term drift and triggers strategy synthesis when necessary. Together the functions implement a closed loop of constraint enforcement and adaptive reconfiguration, forming a recursively self-adapting reasoning engine within the Constraint Lattice.
