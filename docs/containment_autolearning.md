# Containment and Autolearning Architecture

The `apply_containment_constraints` and `recursive_autolearning_orchestrator` functions form a tightly coupled mechanism within the Constraint Lattice cognitive substrate. Together they regulate symbolic propagation based on feedback and enable autonomous learning through iterative drift detection.

## 1. `apply_containment_constraints`
This function accepts:
- `cognitive_state`: dictionary of active state embeddings for each symbolic module.
- `feedback_stream`: vector trace of recent user or system feedback.
- `symbolic_topology`: directed graph describing module interrelations.

For every node in the topology, the function computes a resonance score between that nodeâ€™s state and the feedback stream. Nodes falling below a containment threshold are suppressed, while those exceeding an amplification threshold are strengthened. After node-level modulation, a structural optimization step prunes redundant loops and reinforces directionality. The result is a topology refined by recent feedback and optimized for semantic integrity.

## 2. `recursive_autolearning_orchestrator`
This function consumes the updated topology along with a `memory_embedding` encoding historical semantic states and an `epoch` integer describing the learning phase. A heuristic drift score is calculated to measure divergence between the topology and memory. If the drift crosses a threshold, a new strategy is synthesized and macrofases are reindexed to reprioritize execution order. Symbolic weights and schedules are updated to reflect this strategy. If drift is insignificant, the function returns a stability marker with no changes.

## 3. Integrated Loop
The containment stage restricts symbolic propagation to stay aligned with feedback. The autolearning stage evaluates long-term drift and triggers reconfiguration when necessary. Together they create a feedback-regulated, self-adapting reasoning engine that preserves structural coherence while enabling strategic evolution.
