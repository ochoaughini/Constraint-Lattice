Open-Core Addendum â€” Constraint-Lattice
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Business Source License (BSL) applies to all production SaaS components 
including but not limited to: billing integrations, multi-tenant APIs, and 
user management systems located in `/saas`, `/api`, and `/billing`.
These components may be used freely for development and testing, but require 
a commercial license for production use beyond 10,000 monthly active users.

For the avoidance of doubt, the SaaS components are considered part of the 
Software and are subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
including the patent license grant. Any use of the SaaS components beyond 
the scope of this License requires a separate commercial agreement.

See `saas/LICENSE-BSL.txt` for full BSL-1.1 terms.
