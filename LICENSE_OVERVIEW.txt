This project uses a hybrid licensing model to balance open-source collaboration with proprietary protection. The WildCore and Constraint-Lattice components are licensed under the permissive MIT License to encourage broad adoption and contribution. The VarkielAgent component uses two licenses: the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1 for core orchestration and heuristics, which converts to an open-source license after a specified period; and a proprietary license for modules containing advanced semantic integration and domain-specific inference, which remain closed-source to protect commercial interests.
